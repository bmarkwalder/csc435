            <h3>20 Concepts:</h3>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">01. Transparency:</p>
            <p>Transparency is an effort to make the distributed system invisible to the user, so the user cannot see the distributed system. A main goal of transparency is to hide the architecture of the various systems in the distributed system. If the architecture is hidden that means an agreement is in place on how data is represented, meaning it does not matter what kind of machine, or operating system is currently involved in the system and reading or manipulating the data.</p>
            <p>There are several types of transparency to consider. Location transparency refers to not knowing the location of a data object, process, or thread within the system. URLs are a good example of location transparency. brandonmarkwalder.com tells the end user nothing about the fact that the files that drive my site sit on a virtual private server somewhere in New York. A related type is relocation transparency which simply states that the end user cannot tell if the files have been moved from one location to another. Concurrency transparency is the effect of hiding the use of shared files and resources. With concurrency transparency, Bob would not be aware that Alice is currently reading data from the same table as he is at the same time. Most importantly we have failure transparency, which prevents the user from knowing that a part of the system has failed. Failure transparency is generally difficult to achieve, mainly because it is often hard to distinguish between a process that has failed and one that is simply taking a long time to complete.</p>
            <p>Transparency is not always a good thing. The following example inspired by one provided in class demonstrates this concept swimmingly:</p>
            <p>You are developing a time lapse video of a seasonal change as a fun project with your toddler. The general workflow is to have the camera send a video stream to a remote location so you can review a dayâ€™s worth of images quickly and choose the one that best fits the motif of the film. However, that video stream goes down because a certain toddler unplugged the cable modem. Knowing that the system has a backup 2400 baud modem, you call your wife and tell her to hit the big red button which fires up the low bandwidth connection and tells the system to send a single image. Although we did not have a video stream to choose a best image from, we do still have the day captured, meaning the time lapse photo series completely captures the seasonal change.</p>

            <p>There is almost always a compromise and there is no global clock. The following concepts are important but will not be covered in class and they will likely make good 20 concepts topics:</p>
            <li>Parallel Computing</li>
            <li>Grid Computing</li>
            <li>Cluster Computing</li>
            <li>Distributed Operating Systems</li>
            <li>Shared memory Systems</li>
            <li>Distributed Algorithms</li>
            <p></p>
            <p>The motivation behind distributed systems is to protect sensitive applications while leaving less sensitive applications more accessible.</p>
            <p>Boundary policies are like proxies.</p>
            <p>Middleware is the layer of software running independently on each computer but makes it appear as though the application is running on a single system.</p>
            <p>Transparency is an effort to make the distributed system invisible to the user, so the user cannot see the distributed system. Transparency is not always a good thing.</p>
